I recently replaced my Mac.  New hardware and new OS.  

Now was the time to get it configured as an awesome programming machine.   I plan to list all what and how in the next post.  

At this time I going to start with how did I get this started.  <ol>
<li> Set up Git.  The first time I ran through this, I realized that I hadn't set up by ssh keys on this computer.  This caused a bunch of permission error when I tried to deploy.  <br><https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys>
<li> Start with Octopress. <br><http://octopress.org/>
<li> How to set some better configuration. <br><http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-and-configure-octopress-on-a-mac/> 
<li> Create your repository in Git.   I forgot that step the first time also.<br>
<https://github.com/new>
<li> Ready to deploy.<br>
<http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/>
<li> Wait.   After you deploy, GitHub still needs to get the pages built.   They will send you an email when it is ready.
</ol>
